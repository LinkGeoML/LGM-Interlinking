This Python code implements and evaluates the proposed LinkGeoML models for Toponym classification-based interlinking.

In this setting, we consider the names of the toponyms as the only source of information that can be used to decide
whether two toponyms refer to the same real-world entity.
Specifically, we build a meta-similarity function, called *LGM-Sim*, that takes into account
and incorporates within its processing steps the specificities of toponym names. Consequently, we derive training features
from **LGM-Sim** that are used in various classification models. The proposed method and its derived features are robust
enough to handle variations in the distribution of toponyms and demonstrate a significant increase in interlinking
accuracy compared to baseline models widely used in the literature (see `References`_). Indicatively, we succeed a 85.6% accuracy with
the Gradient Boosting Trees classifier compared to the best baseline model that achieves accuracy of 78.6% with Random
Forests.

The *data* folder contains the train datasets, which are used to build the classifiers, and files containing frequent terms,
extracted from train datasets. For evaluation, we used the dataset from
the `Toponym-Matching <https://github.com/ruipds/Toponym-Matching>`_ work (see `Setup procedure`_).

    The **scripts** folder contains the evaluation setting used to execute the experiments and collect the results presented in the paper:
      - `./scripts/basic_train_latin.sh`: collect the effectiveness values for the **basic** setup on the **100k latin** dataset;
      - `./scripts/lgm_train_latin.sh`: collect the effectiveness values for the **LGM** setup on the **100k latin** dataset;
      - `./scripts/basic_train_global.sh`: collect the effectiveness values for the **basic** setup on the **100k global** dataset;
      - `./scripts/lgm_train_global.sh`: collect the effectiveness values for the **LGM** setup on the **100k global** dataset;
      - `./scripts/basic_test_100klatin_parameter_based.sh`: collect the effectiveness values for the **basic** setup on the global dataset with hyper parameters obtained on the **100k latin train** dataset;
      - `./scripts/lgm_test_100klatin_parameter_based.sh`: collect the effectiveness values for the LGM setup on the global dataset with hyper parameters obtained on the **100k latin train** dataset;
      - `./scripts/basic_test_100kglobal_parameter_based.sh`: collect the effectiveness values for the **basic** setup on the global dataset with hyper parameters obtained on the **100k global train** dataset;
      - `./scripts/lgm_test_100kglobal_parameter_based.sh`: collect the effectiveness values for the **LGM** setup on the global dataset with hyper parameters obtained on the **100k global train** dataset.

The source code was tested using Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6 and Scikit-Learn 0.20.3 on a Linux server.

Setup procedure
---------------

Download the latest version from the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/LinkGeoML/LGM-Interlinking.git>`_, change to
the main directory and run:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -r pip_requirements.txt

It should install all the required libraries automatically (*scikit-learn, numpy, pandas etc.*).

Change to the **data** folder, download the test dataset and unzip it:

.. code-block:: bash

   wget https://github.com/ruipds/Toponym-Matching/raw/master/dataset/dataset.zip
   wget https://github.com/ruipds/Toponym-Matching/raw/master/dataset/dataset.z01

   zip -FF dataset.zip  --out dataset.zip.fixed
   unzip dataset.zip.fixed
